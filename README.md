# Calculator Designs
- You have two different calculator designs here.  
- They are basic calculators made with: `html`, `css` and `js`.  
- They have a pretty nice appearance and can be used without problems because they have `no bugs`.  
- Both use the `eval()` function to calculate the value that is in the `input`.
